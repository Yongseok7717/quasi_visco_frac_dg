# Quasi-static viscoelasticity model of a power-law type

We solve a quasi-static linear viscoelasticity problem of a power-law model.
The governing equation is a vector-valued hyperbolic-type evolution equation involving fractional order time derivative/integral.
In this numerical simulation, we employ the *symmetric interior penalty Galerkin method* (SIPG) for spatial discretization, and the *linear interpolation technique* with *Crank-Nicolson scheme* for temporal discretization, respectively.
For more details on the *a priori* and *a posteriori* analyses and numerical experiments, please refer to our manuscript.

Codes for numerical simulations have been implemented with [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org) version 2019.1.0 in Python scripts (e.g. Python 3.11.4)
